<p>I’ve travelled the country performing for audiences. The gigs closer to home are always a blast.</p>

<p>Cornwall has some amazing venues this one is on the North Coast. <a href="https://www.scarlethotel.co.uk/">The Scarlet hotel</a>. It’s an awesome place.</p>

<p>It was an odd moment walking in and everyone wondering who the hell I was. The Bride’s face dropped. It was written on all their faces is this the stripper!?</p>

<p>The booker introduced me to the bride. We sensed an awkward moment. I introduce myself. “Evening everyone I’m Harris. The table Magician Cornwall.”</p>

<p>Relief filled the room. Everyone relaxes and we had a great evening.</p>

<p>Remember never confuse a magician for a stripper. And if your looking for alternative entertainment on your hen do get in touch. A table magician might be what you’re after.</p>
