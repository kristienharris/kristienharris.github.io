So I'm teaming up with the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://thebespokebrideguide.co.uk" target="_blank">Bespoke Bride Guide Plymouth</a></span>. Laura and the team are launching a brilliant site to promote wedding services in and around the Plymouth area.

I'm looking forward to launch day at Devonport Guildhall on **Sunday 7 June 2015**.The launch day will bring exhbitors together to showcase their wedding services.
  
I will be walking and mingling with the crowds showcasing my skills as a magician. Hopefully see you there!
