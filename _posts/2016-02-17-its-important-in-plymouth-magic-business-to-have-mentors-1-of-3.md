## Even professional magicians need lifelong mentors

I’d like to share with 3 mentors who have helped me progress. Here is the first. By way of introducing me to the larger world of magic he’s helped me become a better magician and has been a great friend. Professional, polite and good humored don’t do the man justice. He’s a treasure of Plymouth and here’s why.

This post is about **[Malcolm Norton](https://www.topsecretmagic.co.uk/MalNorton.html "visit Malcolm's website")** and how he hopes others follow ‘suit’. Malcolm is a dear friend and a great magician. Not only has he owned a magic shop for decades but he’s worked some of the biggest stages and everything in between. A member of The Prestigous London Magic Circle he’s met some of the biggest names (Margaret Thatcher!) and get’s visits from the likes of Derren Brown, Paul Zerdin and Gok Wan!

Here’s [the article](https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/Plymouth-magic-man-Malcolm-Norton-hopes-follow/story-18246713-detail/story.html) I got inspiration for this post from.

Basically ‘Mal’ is the perfect mentor for a Magician from Plymouth.

## **I once wrote down things Mal taught me and why I think it’s important for a professional magician in Plymouth**:

> Don’t buy it now. Go away think about it and come back. You might think yea I can use that. You might not

Amateur magicians have an obsession with new toys professionals build an act with less same goes for hiring an act

> “Don’t carry too many tricks”

Entertainment isn’t about tricks it’s about engagement and enjoyment—you don’t need a lot of stuff to entertain.

> "Keep it as simple as possible. Maybe I’m lazy”

Amateurs often use complicated presentations lots of trickery and less amazement.

> “Ask yourself is it necessary?”

Is what I’m saying or doing making a great experience for someone?

> “Wear a suit”

A good suit that stands out sets a good mood and gives people confidence in you and confidence in yourself–power dress.

> “Wear a good pair of shoes with a tuxedo”

Unless your act is Dynamo’s wear shoes with your Tux–people will notice.

> “Don’t copy someone’s act. They might tear a strip off you (Billy McCombe)”

A lot of amatuers and even some pro’s rip off an act word for word so it’s not genuine–borrow don’t steal and make it your own so your audience gets a show from you not someone else.

> “Do you need it?”

Is it going to work for your act? Does it really make your entertainment better?

Mal has helped in many other ways and these are only a few of his nuggets of wisdom. I’ve know Mal now for 15 years and only recently did I perform my first professional gig with him and what a moment.

Hopefully this helps you to see how magicians like other professionals should seek professional development and it should come from the best.

As the old addage goes
