I sent you this because you booked me. I appreciate you a lot. If you can write me a review that would be great. I'd love you lot's more. Who said love was un-conditional.

## Google review
The best way to review me is on the Harris Magic Google Business listing.

1. Just search for 'harris magic' in Google Search or in Google Maps.
2. On the Harris Magic listing there is an option to review.
3. It will ask you to login or create an account.
4. You can then write your review.
5. Add photos to the review if you have any.
6. Submit your review and I'll get back to you.

I understand if you don't have the time. But would love you if you did.
