I"¨<p>When thousands of people gather for the benefit of the few you should gather to. Communities rely and thrive on help from everyone. So I do my best to help when I can.</p>

<p>Not everyone is guaranteed a long and fruitful life. The race for life is a time for celebrating survivors, remembering the lost and fighting for those still battling cancer.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve performed for free at this event for 3 years running. Every time their gratitude is so great. They are all warming positive people helping each other make a better life for those around them.</p>

<p>Last year they gave me an unexpected certificate at a celebration they were having. To thank me for the support Iâ€™d shown them. Hiring entertainment costs money and the thought that they thanked me in such a way just goes to show theyâ€™re grateful.</p>

<p>I canâ€™t believe the positive attitude of the people. I meet cancer survivors and perform for them whilst they have a tea and lunch. Friends and strangers talk, smile and laugh. It amazes me that they are quick to smile and forget the bad times, remember the good and move on.</p>

<p>Meeting these people has changed me for the better. I question myself less. Appreciate other people more and I hope that Iâ€™ll have the resilience and strength that they do when I see adversity. Real adversity.</p>

<p>People camp in the wind, rain and sunshine. All weather and walk for 24 hours. Kids camp and help raise money on stalls pitched outside a makeshift camp made in the middle of a local school field.</p>

<p>Music hums, the big band plays and a DJ plays music throughout the day. Heâ€™s keeping the walkers walking and the relay running by the beat of a drum and the strength of a hundred hearts.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s music in the crowd even when no instruments play. When people gather and move for a cause together we all feel the fruits of solidarity.</p>

<p>Show me the way relay runners. Show me the way and Iâ€™ll walk.</p>
