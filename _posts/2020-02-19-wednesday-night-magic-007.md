This time it was just Mal Norton and I. We had a full house and people standing! The sound went a little smoother this time and the venue have had some good lighting installed that allows us to control it a bit more for theatrical effect.

After chatting with the boss he is keen to get us a dedictated sound guy and some head mics in to up the game.

These shows are getting better every month and the audiences seem to keep coming.
