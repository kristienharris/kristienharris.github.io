I"ù<p>Iâ€™ve not a clue how this happened. It did though. A virus has halted the earth and no one knows what to do. Panic buying. Misinformation. Social distancing and a whole world of people that have no idea what to do.</p>

<p>Right now we are expereincing something extraordinary. A world rife with disease and no cure. A world fuelled with fear an un-certainty.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve had a few group shows cancelled because of the uncertainty. My preparations for up comming shows now have much more time.</p>
