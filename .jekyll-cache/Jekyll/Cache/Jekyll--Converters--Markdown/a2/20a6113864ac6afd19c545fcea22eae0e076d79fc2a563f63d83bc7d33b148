I"Ð<p>I wasÂ a long standing member of the Plymouth Magic Circle (PMC). I served as secretary for several years and helped promote, organise andÂ arrange shows and meetings.</p>

<p>The PMC meet once a month on the second Thursday of every month. Check out the calendar on the Facebook page.</p>

<p>The club promotes magical arts and entertainment in the South West and gives like minded hobbyists and workers like myself to get better at their craft and trade.</p>
