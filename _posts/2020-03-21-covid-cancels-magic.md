I've not a clue how this happened. It did though. A virus has halted the earth and no one knows what to do. Panic buying. Misinformation. Social distancing and a whole world of people that have no idea what to do.

Right now we are expereincing something extraordinary. A world rife with disease and no cure. A world fuelled with fear an un-certainty.

I've had a few group shows cancelled because of the uncertainty. My preparations for up comming shows now have much more time.
