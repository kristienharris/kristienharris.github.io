I"»<p>So many slick looking suited and booted bozos parade the magic market.</p>

<p>Anyone can buy a trick these days. Go on google magic trick shops and youâ€™ll find them. Tons of effects, prepacked and available for all.</p>

<p>A good performer will light up a room.</p>

<p>They donâ€™t just remember names and make people laugh.</p>

<p>They make jaws drop.</p>

<p>They make everyone look.</p>

<p>They make them want to see more!</p>

<p>They donâ€™t interrupt conversations they start them.</p>

<p>They donâ€™t finish conversations they let them continue.</p>

<p>They break the ice.</p>

<p>They light the fire and let the desire burn with secrets.</p>

<p>They unite a room, the table the bride and groom.</p>

<p>They do all of these things. One thing they donâ€™t do is make you feel stupid. They donâ€™t make people look stupid.</p>

<p>They empower people with the confidence to relax enjoy the moment and hopefully remember it forever.</p>
