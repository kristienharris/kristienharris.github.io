<p>I’d like to share with 3 mentors who have helped me progress. Here is the first. By way of introducing me to the larger world of magic he’s helped me become a better magician and has been a great friend. Professional, polite and good humored don’t do the man justice. He’s a treasure of Plymouth and here’s why.</p>

<p>This post is about <strong><a href="http://www.topsecretmagic.co.uk/MalNorton.html" title="visit Malcolm's website">Malcolm Norton</a></strong> and how he hopes others follow ‘suit’. Malcolm is a dear friend and a great magician. Not only has he owned a magic shop for decades but he’s worked some of the biggest stages and everything in between. A member of The Prestigous London Magic Circle he’s met some of the biggest names (Margaret Thatcher!) and get’s visits from the likes of Derren Brown, Paul Zerdin and Gok Wan!</p>

<p>Here’s <a href="http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/Plymouth-magic-man-Malcolm-Norton-hopes-follow/story-18246713-detail/story.html">the article</a> I got inspiration for this post from.</p>

<p>Basically ‘Mal’ is the perfect mentor for a Magician from Plymouth.</p>

<h2 id="i-once-wrote-down-things-mal-taught-meand-why-i-think-its-important-for-a-professional-magician-inplymouth"><strong>I once wrote down things Mal taught me and why I think it’s important for a professional magician in Plymouth</strong>:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t buy it now. Go away think about it and come back. You might think yea I can use that. You might not</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amateur magicians have an obsession with new toys professionals build an act with less same goes for hiring an act</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Don’t carry too many tricks”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Entertainment isn’t about tricks it’s about engagement and enjoyment—you don’t need a lot of stuff to entertain.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Keep it as simple as possible. Maybe I’m lazy”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amateurs often use complicated presentations lots of trickery and less amazement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ask yourself is it necessary?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is what I’m saying or doing making a great experience for someone?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Wear a suit”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A good suit that stands out sets a good mood and gives people confidence in you and confidence in yourself–power dress.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Wear a good pair of shoes with a tuxedo”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless your act is Dynamo’s wear shoes with your Tux–people will notice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Don’t copy someone’s act. They might tear a strip off you (Billy McCombe)”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of amatuers and even some pro’s rip off an act word for word so it’s not genuine–borrow don’t steal and make it your own so your audience gets a show from you not someone else.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Do you need it?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it going to work for your act? Does it really make your entertainment better?</p>

<p>Mal has helped in many other ways and these are only a few of his nuggets of wisdom. I’ve know Mal now for 15 years and only recently did I perform my first professional gig with him and what a moment.</p>

<p>Hopefully this helps you to see how magicians like other professionals should seek professional development and it should come from the best.</p>

<p>As the old addage goes</p>
