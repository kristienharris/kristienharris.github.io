So many slick looking suited and booted bozos parade the magic market. 

Anyone can buy a trick these days. Go on google magic trick shops and you'll find them. Tons of effects, prepacked and available for all.

A good performer will light up a room.

They don't just remember names and make people laugh.

They make jaws drop.

They make everyone look.

They make them want to see more! 

They don't interrupt conversations they start them.

They don't finish conversations they let them continue.

They break the ice.

They light the fire and let the desire burn with secrets.

They unite a room, the table the bride and groom.

They do all of these things. One thing they don't do is make you feel stupid. They don't make people look stupid.

They empower people with the confidence to relax enjoy the moment and hopefully remember it forever.
