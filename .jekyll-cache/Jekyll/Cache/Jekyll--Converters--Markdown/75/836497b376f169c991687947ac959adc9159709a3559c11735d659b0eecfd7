I"þ<p>A <a href="https://foxrobin.com/">magician friend of mine</a>Â couldnâ€™t make a friends wedding and recommended me for it. Itâ€™s nice being able to help out other magicians and even nicer when someone recommends you. I was excited after speaking to Robin about the wedding of two delightful women and he gave me their number so I gave them a call.</p>

<p>She was delightful and I got a good feeling after our chat. If you get on itâ€™s a good sign and the gig is likely to go better. Remember ask yourself do you like their manner and would you like their company. Theyâ€™ll be spending the whole time bustling around making conversations and atmosphere so itâ€™s important you like them a bit.</p>

<p>If a magicians manner isnâ€™t to your taste they might not be right for your guests. Close up mingling magic is not like a theatre show, hence the magician needs people skills and without them yourâ€™e gambling the magic will be enough to engage them. Magicians canâ€™t just get by on good tricks in those scenarios. Building theatrical atmosphere is not easy.</p>

<p>I rocked up to Dawlish Manor and got stuck in on the day. The picture, at the top of the post, is the first group I got to mingle with. The group looked engrossed and set a lovely tone for the rest of the day. As a result I knew it would be good gig. Nice conversations and good weather all made a perfect wedding.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone absolutely loved your skills, and if your ears have been burning in the last week, itâ€™s because lots of people were telling us how brilliant you were! Everyone loved your style and the craziness of your magic.</p>

  <p>You added a real element of pizzazz, and Iâ€™m so grateful that you were a part of our big day. Thank you so much.</p>

  <p>Attached is a photo my sister took.</p>

  <p>You will always be part of a life long memory, how precious is that!</p>

<p>Weddings are very precious indeed and the more gigs I get to the more my eyes open to how wonderful it is being at them. I canâ€™t wait till the next one so I can meet some more beautiful people. Letâ€™s see if together we can create some laughter, some wonder and definitely some magic that will be a life long memory.</p>
