I was a long standing member of the Plymouth Magic Circle (PMC). I served as secretary for several years and helped promote, organise and arrange shows and meetings.

The PMC meet once a month on the second Thursday of every month. Check out the calendar on the Facebook page.

The club promotes magical arts and entertainment in the South West and gives like minded hobbyists and workers like myself to get better at their craft and trade.
