I"<p>I have an agent that believes in me. I know that because they book me regularly for the forces gigs in the Devon. I’ve prformed for the Royal Marines and the Royal Navy officers mess.</p>

<p>The reason he believes in me is because someone else told him they thought I was good and worth hiring. At the time I didn’t even think I’d be good enough. You never do.</p>

<p>One get’s paid to pay me the other had blind faith. He said I was ready. Put me by the edge of the deep end and pushed. I jumped. Even still I’m always improving. Always getting better but at that first gig it hit me.</p>

<p>I’m stood in a room with people more trained, more experienced and better paid than me. Get ready it’s course language the boss says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We all piss, we all $#1t we all bleed we all breathe. Don’t let em intimidate you just get out there and show em what you got.
<strong>Anon</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I laughed and it stuck with me that moment. He was right. I’ve served our forces many times now. Every time I feel privileged, lucky and grateful.</p>

<p>By forces unseen I move from table to table; hoping I can get the whole room to ignite. I want to light a life lived by fire. It’s the least I can do for those people who go above and beyond for all of us.</p>

<p>I want the rooms boom with joy. Love and wonder mingle as a glass is raised and they toast to the present. I want them to feel truth, love and wonder. I’ll continue to wander when others believe in me.</p>

<p>We are all miracles reflected in those moments when you see how special we all are. All special forces in some sense.</p>

<p>Even if I’m only doing tricks I’d like to think the small moments I give make some difference.</p>

<p>Good luck, god speed and peace be with you soldier.</p>
