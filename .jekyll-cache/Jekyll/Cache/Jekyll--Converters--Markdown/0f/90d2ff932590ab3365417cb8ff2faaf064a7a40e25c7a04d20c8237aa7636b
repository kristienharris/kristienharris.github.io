I"Ä<p>It started with a story of my grandad who would use a pocket knife up his sleeve to steal cuttings from a garden centre. Naughty but clever. I thought he was a magician because he hid things up his sleeve. My dad taught me how to cut a deck of cards with one hand and told us how they used to illegally gamble when he worked in the dessert and my mums friend taught me how to play cards and riffle shuffle.</p>

<p>After that I learnt how to vanish things and then I learnt how to make it entertaining and funny.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s one thing having a great origin story but when it comes to entertaining an audience full of people it takes more than fancy words. You need to be able to handle a stage, a microphone and an audience. Iâ€™ve honed those skills over tens years now and have performed for a wide variety of clients including corporate tradehsows, weddings, private parties and charities.</p>
