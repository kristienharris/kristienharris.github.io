I"l<p>I ask myself what secrets do these hands know. When I do the hands reply we don’t know.</p>

<p>But then they remember the things they’ve shown and it seems theres more than things known.</p>

<p>They see more than all things known. Move through light not fast not slow.</p>

<p>And then that’s when they see wonder grow. Smiles show more than glow.</p>
