<blockquote>
  <p>The child that is born on the Sabbath day</p>

  <p>Is blithe and bonny,good and gay;</p>

  <p>Mondayâ€™s child is fair of face;</p>

  <p>Tuesdayâ€™s child is full of grace;</p>

  <p>Wednesdayâ€™s child is merry and glad;</p>

  <p>Thursdayâ€™s child is sour and sad;</p>

  <p>Fridayâ€™s child is loving and giving;</p>

  <p>And Saturdayâ€™s child must work for its living.</p>
