title: iON Camera Trade Show

I worked at Wembley stadium for iON cameras doing close-up for guests coming in to the trade stand. Had a bit of a play with the camera for the show reel that iON made as well. It's only a snippet of magic but my first debut in a mainstream promotional video. Pretty pleased with it!

Also during the world series break I met David Haye. Just missed a punch up after showing him a trick or two. It now only occurs to me he was humouring me having seen a clip of him in one of Dynamos videos.
