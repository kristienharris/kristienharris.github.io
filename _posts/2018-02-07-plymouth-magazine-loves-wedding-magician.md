I was featured in a Plymouth Magazine as a supplier of wedding entertainment. It was such a pleasure to be included. There are some cheeky pictures for it. Here are the choice cuts and a clipping from the magazine.

If you would like to book me for a wedding in Plymouth, Devon or Cornwall then get in touch.

Check out the article in the gallery below. Quite pleased to have the feature and thanks to Daisy Williams for the photos.
