I"P<p>A fortune telling song which I will use to pick spectators. Hereâ€™s an idea. Someone is hiding a black marble. The rest are hiding a clear marble. A spectator is asked to chose someone from the audience. We use the ryhme to find the one who holds the black marble.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tinker, Tailor,</p>

  <p>Soldier, Sailor,</p>

  <p>Rich Man, Poor Man,</p>

  <p>Beggar Man, Thief,</p>

  <p>Doctor, Lawyer,</p>

  <p>Merchant, Chief.</p>
