Snowing at a stately home in an arboretum! What a magical day.

It being Christmas reminded me of a gift I was given one year by my mum. She'd bought me a rubik cube.

At this place I met a young lad who had a rubix cube. I was at a wedding and he'd brought his cube along to keep himself entertained or maybe his parents packed it for him. I'll never know. I should have asked.

I was intent on helping him out and explained the easiest way to do it. As I explain I realise I've forgotten. I can't remember a single move.

I was about his age, maybe 12 when I got mine.
