I've had a few shows cancelled and some waiting in limbo. Who knows what is going to happen now.

I've not a clue how this happened. It did though. A virus has halted the earth and no one knows what to do. Panic buying. Misinformation. Social distancing and a whole world of people that have no idea what to do.

Right now we are expereincing something extraordinary. A world rife with disease and no cure. A world fuelled with fear an un-certainty.
