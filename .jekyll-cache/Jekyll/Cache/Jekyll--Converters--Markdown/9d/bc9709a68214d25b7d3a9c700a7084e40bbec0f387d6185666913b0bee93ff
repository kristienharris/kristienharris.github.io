I"j<p>This time it was just Mal Norton and I. We had a full house and people standing! The sound went a little smoother this time and the venue have had some good lighting installed that allows us to control it a bit more for theatrical effect.</p>

<p>After chatting with the boss he is keen to get us a dedictated sound guy and some head mics in to up the game.</p>

<p>These shows are getting better every month and the audiences seem to keep coming.</p>
