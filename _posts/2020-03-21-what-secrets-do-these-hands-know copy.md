title: What secrets do these hands know
author: Harris

I ask myself what secrets do these hands know. When I do the hands reply we don't know.

But then they remember the things they've shown and it seems theres more than things known.

They see more than all things known. Move through light not fast not slow.

And then that's when they see wonder grow. Smiles show more than glow.
