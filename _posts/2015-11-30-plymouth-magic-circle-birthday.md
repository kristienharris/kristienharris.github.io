What a show. I helped orchestrate the Plymouth Magic Circles 80th Anniversary show. It was a blast. At least 8 performers and over 90 guests and all tickets sold. We made this magic show a success.

One of the highlights was Mark James performing as the headliner. Mark is an outstanding performer. Hilariously funny and a lovely bloke. We got to hear Mark speak about his magic. I think the Plymouth Magicians club would have him back again!

This show was a great step forward for the Plymouth Magic Circle. It got local press involvement and magicians were featured on TV and radio as part of the buildup.
