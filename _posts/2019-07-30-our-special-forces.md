I have an agent that believes in me. I know that because they book me regularly for the forces gigs in the Devon. I've prformed for the Royal Marines and the Royal Navy officers mess.

The reason he believes in me is because someone else told him they thought I was good and worth hiring. At the time I didn't even think I'd be good enough. You never do.

One get's paid to pay me the other had blind faith. He said I was ready. Put me by the edge of the deep end and pushed. I jumped. Even still I'm always improving. Always getting better but at that first gig it hit me.

I'm stood in a room with people more trained, more experienced and better paid than me. Get ready it's course language the boss says

  >We all piss, we all $#1t we all bleed we all breathe. Don't let em intimidate you just get out there and show em what you got.
  >**Anon**

I laughed and it stuck with me that moment. He was right. I've served our forces many times now. Every time I feel privileged, lucky and grateful.

By forces unseen I move from table to table; hoping I can get the whole room to ignite. I want to light a life lived by fire. It's the least I can do for those people who go above and beyond for all of us.

I want the rooms boom with joy. Love and wonder mingle as a glass is raised and they toast to the present. I want them to feel truth, love and wonder. I'll continue to wander when others believe in me.

We are all miracles reflected in those moments when you see how special we all are. All special forces in some sense. 

Even if I'm only doing tricks I'd like to think the small moments I give make some difference.

Good luck, god speed and peace be with you soldier.
