I recently got booked for a hen party looking for a table magician. They booked me over a lot of other magicians. Good stuff. This stories funny get ready for it.

## Tip: Don't confuse a table magician for a stripper üòâ

I've travelled the country performing for audiences. The gigs closer to home are always a blast.

Cornwall has some amazing venues this one is on the North Coast. [The Scarlet hotel](https://www.scarlethotel.co.uk/). It‚Äôs an awesome place.

It was an odd moment walking in and everyone wondering who the hell I was. The Bride's face dropped. It was written on all their faces is this the stripper!?

The booker introduced me to the bride. We sensed an awkward moment. I introduce myself. ‚ÄúEvening everyone I‚Äôm Harris. The table Magician Cornwall.‚Äù

Relief filled the room. Everyone relaxes and we had a great evening.

Remember never confuse a magician for a stripper. And if your looking for alternative entertainment on your hen do get in touch. A table magician might be what you're after.

If you're not organising a hen do Plymouth magazine loved me as a¬†[wedding magician.](http://www.kristienharris.com/plymouth-magazine-loves-wedding-magician/)

## Questions to ask a table magician before booking:

What will happen when you arrive?

How will we know you've finished your performance?

What will happen when you perform?

How do you want paying?

Do you have any [terms and conditions](http://kristienharris.com/terms-and-conditions/)?

Do you have public liability insurance?

## Things to ask yourself before booking a table magician:

Is the magician a people person?

Do my guests like magic?

Does the table magician have any reviews? (are they good?)

Are they a member of any magic societies or performers guild?
