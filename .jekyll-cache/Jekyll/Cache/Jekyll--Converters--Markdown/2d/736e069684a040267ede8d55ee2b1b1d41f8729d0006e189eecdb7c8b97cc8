I"7<p>Only at a birthday party at someones home could this happen. A lovely lady enjoyed the show from the safety of her house in the Falkland islands! The hosts sister wanted to be a part of the festivities and see her Dad take part in the show. Who’d have thought you don’t have to be at the show to experience it! Thanks to video calling and a good wifi connection we had a blast. In fact it added to the atmosphere and the madness of it all as she was loving the show so much. Her reactions were priceless and were received as well as if she had been there.</p>
