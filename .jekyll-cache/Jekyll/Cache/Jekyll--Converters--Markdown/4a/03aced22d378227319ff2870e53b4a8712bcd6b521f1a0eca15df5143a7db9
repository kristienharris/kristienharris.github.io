I"¨<p>One of the hats that I wear as a professional is that of a creative. I paint, illustrate, design and build things for people as a job. Itâ€™s not often someone wants to hear about that but recently the opportunity to share some of the things I know did.</p>

<p>I was asked to give a talk on the magic of writing the perfect creative brief. It was a lightning talk. 10 minutes to be exact and was to a room full of professionals.</p>

<p>I love presenting ideas as much as entertainment. Given the chance to do both lights me up. And apparently Iâ€™ve found out other people enjoy it as well.</p>

<p>The power of magic, entertainment and ideas that make a life better is a powerful cocktail for anyone daring to mix it. But it can have itâ€™s pitfalls if not done correctly.</p>

<p>Shoehorning a magic trick into a presentation or vice versa an idea into a magic trick is a dangerous process. A rewarding process if done right but a risky one.</p>

<p>I find myself thinking of symbols. Parallel ideas that work in both realms with either similar feelings or meanings. Sometimes research finds the right combination sometimes itâ€™s inspired. Mostly itâ€™s hard work.</p>

<p>The more connections you make between interests the more dots you join. The more interest you have the more dots can be joined but without exploring connections arenâ€™t made. The journey is over.</p>

<p>I wonder what opportunities will present themselves next!</p>
