I"Ê<p>I met Sue at a wedding I was booked for in 2017. Sue is the organiser of events at Calstock Arts Centre. We thought it would be a good idea to put on a magic show to raise funds for the centre and to offer something a bit different for the local community.</p>

<p>Calstock Arts is a charity and volunteer led venue that hosts events for the local community and surrounding areas of Cornwall.</p>

<p>So I and another <a href="https://www.malnortonmagician.co.uk">magician</a> went to Cornwall to share some wonder with the world. Turns out they like magic in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Titled Sleightly Mad the show featured sections of my act and the local magic shop owner Mal Norton.</p>

<p>I love working with Mal as heâ€™s a seasoned pro and itâ€™s humbling to work alongside him. Just to think I used to be an amateur wondering if Iâ€™d ever get the chance to be on stage. I guess I have got that chance and Iâ€™m grateful for it. Thanks Mal for all the lessons and wise words.</p>

<p>Hopefully they will find another time later in the year to put on another magic show. My act is always evolving and Iâ€™d love to do another show. Great audience and a lovely venue.</p>

<p>Keep up the good work Sue and the crew. Thanks for being so welcoming and helpful.</p>
