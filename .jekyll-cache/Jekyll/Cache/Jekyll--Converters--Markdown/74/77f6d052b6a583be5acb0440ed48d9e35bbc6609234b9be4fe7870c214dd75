<blockquote>
  <p>Something old,<br />
something new,<br />
something borrowed,<br />
something blue,<br />
and a sixpence in her shoe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is this superstitious rambling? It looks like something about the success of a marriage based on folklore. Or is it more than that? Itâ€™s up to you to decide. Here are some thoughts that I hope to use in my wedding performances.</p>

<p>If youâ€™ve ever heard this rhyme then youâ€™ve experienced the magic of marriage. The trust in the known and the unknown. The future, the past and the present are all encapsulated in this short verse.</p>

<p>I perform at a lot of weddings. I encounter objects, like the ones in the verse, in some way. For example I borrow something, use old objects wear blue and find coins in many places even shoes. You wonâ€™t find me wearing a garter though</p>

<p>But I do take faith in the objects I use to create experiences. The faith in this rhyme apparently changes the future.</p>

<p>It sounds like weddings are ancient magic to me.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-the-lines-symbolise">What do the lines symbolise?</h2>

<p><strong>The sentence Something old</strong> provide protection for the life to come.</p>

<p><strong>Something newÂ </strong></p>

<p><strong>Something borrowed</strong> brings luck from a previous marriage. Also protects against the evil eye in some accounts.</p>

<p><strong>Something blue</strong> is as symbol of fidelity. With the help of the borrowed item staves off the evil eye. The blue item was traditionally the garter â€˜plucked offâ€™ by the groom and thrown. Hence plucking the garter.</p>

<p><strong>The six pence</strong> was added later as a symbol of prosperity. Traditionally put in the left shoe.</p>

<h2 id="origination">Origination</h2>

<p>This folklore originates in Lancashire and was added to by victorians so itâ€™s not ancient folklore but still has an air of mystery about it.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-relates-to-magic">How it relates to magic</h2>

<p>A magician relies on a deep seated relationship with myth and folklore. By relying on the same trust in wonder you get a to-and-fro of mystery and hope. Not wanting to know how itâ€™s done is the same as trusting in folklore so that you can have a better time.</p>

<p>So what is the key to a happy marriage? A little bit of magic and some secrets.</p>
