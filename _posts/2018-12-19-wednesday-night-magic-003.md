20:00-22:00 @ [The BBar, Barbican Theatre, Plymouth](https://www.google.com/maps?q=bbar+plymouth&rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB844GB844&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIqIrH6t_iAhUMmxQKHY6IBmIQ_AUIECgB).

Come and see an evening of magical entertainment in Plymouth, comedy and mystery entertainment. Free entry for all first come and first served. Grab some noodles and enjoy the show.

We'll have Chris Tennant and Malcolm Norton with us.

The acts are always a surprise and we do our best to get a new performer each time. If we can't find a new performer then we do make sure to add new material in. Even if you've come before then please visit again.

News can be found on the BBar facebook events page.

You can also see the event [listed on their website](https://www.b-bar.co.uk/search/label/What%27s%20On)Â nearer the time.

Who said Plymouth magic couldn't be real.
